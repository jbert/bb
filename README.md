Working along with [block breakers](https://davidwong.fr/blockbreakers/aes.html) to implement AES from
scratch.

- implement the primitives used by AES
- glue them together to implement AES encrypt
- implement inverses to the primitives
- use them to implement decryption

- implement finite field arithmetic to replace lookup tables
  - although this is strictly worse, since no longer constant time :-)
